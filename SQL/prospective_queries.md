FROM real_estate_listings r
JOIN cost_of_living c ON r.city = c.city AND r.state = c.state
WHERE c.index < 100
GROUP BY r.city, r.state
HAVING AveragePrice < (SELECT AVG(price) FROM real_estate_listings)
ORDER BY AveragePrice ASC;
```

# 2. Find properties near major employers in a desired industry
Utilizing the company dataset, users could search for cities with a significant

FROM real_estate_listings r
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT 1
  FROM companies c

    AND c.state = r.state
)
ORDER BY r.price ASC;
```

AND EXISTS (
  SELECT 1
  FROM job_market_growth j
  WHERE j.city = r.city
    AND j.state = r.state
    AND j.year_over_year_growth > 0
